The DBpedia Ontology is a shallow, cross-domain ontology, which has been manually created based on the most commonly used infoboxes within Wikipedia. 
The ontology currently covers 359 classes which form a subsumption hierarchy and are described by 1,775 different properties.<br />

which is based on hand-generated mappings of Wikipedia infoboxes to the DBpedia ontology. The mappings define fine-granular rules on how
to parse infobox values. The mappings also address weaknesses in the Wikipedia infobox system, like having different infoboxes 
for the same class, using different property names for the same property, and not having clearly defined datatypes for property
values. Therefore, the instance data within the infobox ontology is much cleaner and better structured than the infobox data
within the DBpedia infobox dataset which is generated using the old infobox extraction code.</p><br /><a name="p33738-3"></a>

for writing infobox mappings, editing existing ones as well as editing the DBpedia ontology. This allows external contributors 
to define mappings for the infoboxes they are interested in and to extend the existing DBpedia ontology with additional classes 
and properties.</p><br /><a name="p33738-4"></a><p class="auto" id="p33738-4">Since the DBpedia 3.7 release, the ontology 
is a directed-acyclic graph, not a tree. Classes may have multiple superclasses, which was important for the mappings to

A taxonomy can still be constructed by ignoring all superclasses but the one that is specified first in the list and is considered 
the most important.</p><br /><a name="p33738-5"></a><p class="auto" id="p33738-5">
