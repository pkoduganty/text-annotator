•  Cognizant Case Study

Global Financial Services Provider Extends 
Policy Management System to Enable 
Greater Operational Efficiency

Business Situation
The customer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of one 
of  the  largest  financial  services  and  insurance 
groups in the U.S., with an international presence 
in  Japan,  Brazil  and  the  UK.  Its  Japanese 
subsidiary  started  business  in  December  2000 
and specializes in individual annuity products. 

By  emphasizing  product  development  and  risk 
management  excellence,  coupled  with  superior 
customer  and  distributor  service,  this  client  has 
become a leader in the retirement savings, wealth 
creation  and  financial  protection  solutions  space 
and  is  focused  on  meeting  the  needs  of  Japan’s 
expanding  retirement  income  market.  In  2006, 
the  customer  launched  a  new  variable  annuity 
product. 

Challenge 
With its affiliates, this client sought to enhance its 
Ingenium policy administration system to accom-
modate  repetitive  automated  annuity  payout 
management  functionality  to  address  business 
needs in Japan and the UK, as well as future inter-
national expansion.

• 

Leverage global development capabilities in a 
cost-effective manner. 

Add payout processing for fixed and variable 
annuity products to Ingenium.

This  client  wanted  to  replace  manual  work-
arounds and reduce inefficient, manual processes 
in  its Ingenium-based annuity business system to 
facilitate  greater  business  integrity.  The  annuity 
payout  framework  in  Ingenium  was  identified 
as  software  that  could  automate  the  company’s 
payout process.

To  configure  the  base  Ingenium  package  to 
accommodate  repetitive  payouts  for  variable/
fixed annuity products, the annuity payout system 
needed the following capabilities: 
• 

Variable and fixed automatic annuity payouts 
with history tracking.

• 

• 

• 

Multiple options for payout  
(partial and lump sum).

Multi-currency payout and notification  
to clients.

Annuity contract maintenance.

The objectives included the following:
• 

Leverage an internally developed annuity 
payout solution (Ingenium), globally.

The client hoped that the engagement would 
enable: 
• 

On-time annuity payouts.

• 

A framework for annuitization, which would 
improve turnaround time for annuity payouts 
for a future annuity product suite.

Solution
Our  approach  required  the  base  system  to  be 
configured  for  repetitive  payouts  for  variable 
and fixed annuity products, with the capability of 
automatic  annuity  payouts  with  history  enabled. 
Other features included:

Multiple options for payout  
(partial and lump sum).

•

integration  testing  and  business  acceptance 

testing.  This  approach  completely  satisfied  the 
client in achieving its business objectives.
